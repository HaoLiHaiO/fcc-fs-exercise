# Freecodecamp MERN tutorial

My goal by following this tutorial is to improve my backend skills and 
knowledge. I am also improving the code quality by adding Typescript and using 
ES6 syntax.

## Notes

- using Typescript
- backend is in the same folder because it's a simple example
- bodyParser is deprecated, use new syntax with app.use(express.json())
- temp add isolatedModule set to false to run the server without any export or 
import
- in TS, req and res types must be imported
